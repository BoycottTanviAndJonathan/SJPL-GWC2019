    Though it’s called a leopard—and certainly resembles a frosted 
    version of those spotted habitués of more equatorial regions—the Snow
    Leopard is actually more closely related to the Tiger, at least per
    genetic analysis. Probably fewer than 6,500 remain in the wild, 
    though due to the remote mountainous terrain preferred by the species,
    and its elusive nature, data is hard to come by. The largest populations
    are in China and Mongolia, with significant populations in India and 
    Kyrgyzstan as well. Its natural prey include Blue Sheep and Ibex, 
    but in some areas, it is heavily dependent on domestic animals. 
    The farmers who depend upon the animals shoot the “problem” leopards. 
    Poaching still constitutes a major threat to the species, as does 
    overhunting of its natural prey species.</p11>
