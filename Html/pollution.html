  <h1> Air Pollution</h1>
  <h3>The Causes of Air Pollution</h3>
  <p>The issue is that there is too much garbage. Because of this, incinerators burn garbage to get rid of it. But the garbage contains toxins, so burning it will release toxic smoke into the air. This is a chemical reaction since fire reacts with the garbage, changing its chemical composition, releasing toxins into the air. Today’s garbage contains paper, plastics, and other types of packaging waste that release a hazardous mixture of carcinogens and other toxins when burned. Simply put, when you burn garbage, you release many toxic chemicals into the air. We does this a lot due to overcrowding of landfills, resulting in air pollution. These carcinogens are a substance capable of causing cancer in living tissue. An example of how dioxin in the smoke from burning garbage can end up in our food. When livestock feed that has been contaminated with dioxin, they concentrate the chemical in their milk and meat. This is important as many people consume dairy and meat products, and could seriously harm people. Dioxins are a toxic chemical known for causing various forms of cancer. </p>
  <h3>Solutions for Air Pollution</h3>
  <p>Our solution is to stop using the incinerators and incorporate the 3 R’s. Reuse, Recycle, and Reduce. We should have recycle bins next to garbage cans and to implement the 3 R’s, a campaign might be essential. This helps as we can reduce the amount of garbage by reducing the amount of garbage and plastic we use. As an example, instead of buying plastic water bottles, we can reuse metallic ones. In the case we buy plastic, we can always recycle our garbage so it doesn’t get dumped in a landfill and end up being incinerated. The only change that occurs in my solution is during recycling. Recycling is a physical change, as first the garbage is sorted using physical properties, such as magnetism. Then the garbage that can be recycled is usually melted down, and then molded to become a new object. Melting is just a phase change however, and so is a physical change.</p>
  <h4>How You Can Help</h4>
  <p>There are many small things you can do to prevent air pollution. Any small change can make an impact. One thing you can to prevent air pollution or any type of pollution is using a reusable water bottle. After a while, the amount of plastic water bottles you buy will build up. To avoid this, it's easier to use a reusable water bottle.</p>
