 <h3><u>Vaquita</u></h3>
    <p3>With less than 100 thought to exist, and fewer than 20 vaquita 
    remain in the wild, the Vaquita is the rarest marine mammal in the world. 
    Time is running out for these little sea porpoises, with extinction 
    predicted as soon as 2020. They are found only in the northern Gulf of 
    California (Sea of Cortez) in Mexico. The main reason these sea porpoises 
    are going extinct is mainy because the small animal frequently gets caught 
    in fixed fishing nets (gill-nets), as by-catch. Unable to surface for air,
    the entangled animals drown within minutes. This threat is accelerated by 
    illegal fishing for another endangered species that lives in the vaquita 
    habitat, the totoaba â”€ a large species of fish sought after for its swim 
    bladder, driven by demand from China where it is considered a delicacy 
    with medicinal value.
