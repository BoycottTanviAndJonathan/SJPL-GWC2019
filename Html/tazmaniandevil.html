      Between 1996 and 2008, the population of Tasmanian devils dropped 
    some 60% due a contagious cancer known as Devil Facial Tumour Disease.
    It continues to decimate populations of the species, which only occurs 
    on the Australian island of Tasmania. There may only be 10,000 wild 
    individuals remaining. Captive breeding of uninfected individuals has 
    been instituted and efforts have been made to develop a vaccine for the 
    cancer, which is thought to have stemmed from mutated cells from a 
    single specimen.</p9>
