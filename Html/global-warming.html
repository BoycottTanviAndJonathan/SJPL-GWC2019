          Global warming, also associated with climate change (the words used to describe 
 
          the complex shifts now affecting the planet’s weather and climate systems), is a
 
          problem our planet is facing that began at the beginning of the industrial 
           
          revolution. Global warming, to put it simply, is the gradual increase in the
           
          overall temperature in Earth’s atmosphere. Normally, the Earth’s climate is 
          
          livable in because of the natural greenhouse effect. However, humans have been
     
          enhancing the greenhouse effect by adding loads of carbon dioxide to the
   
          atmosphere.

           The greenhouse effect is warming that happens when certain gases in the Earth’s
 
          atmosphere trap heat. The gases let light in, but they keep heat from escaping out
 
          there. When sunlight shines onto the Earth’s surface, the energy is absorbed there
 
          and then proceeds to radiate back into the atmosphere as heat. In the atmosphere,

           the greenhouse molecules trap some of the heat and let the rest go to space. The
 
          more greenhouse gases concentrate in the atmosphere, the more heat gets locked up

           in the molecules, and causes global warming.

          Global warming is a major problem to us, and only affects more
 
         and more as time passes on. For starters, global warming is
 
         changing the climate faster than some living creatures can
          adapt to. These new and more unpredictable climate poses unique
 
         challenges to life. The weather is becoming more extreme, with

          intense major storms and more rain followed by longer, drier

          droughts. There can be changes in the ranges where crops grow
   
          and animals live, and global warming also provides a loss of
 
          water supplies. In addition, Earth’s remaining ice sheets

          (like Greenland or Antartica) are starting to melt. The extra

          water caused by the melting will add to the rising sea level.
 
         By 2050, scientists predict that the sea level will rise between

          one and 2.3 feet.

       There are many things people can do to stop global warming, and they 
       aren’t very big efforts. In fact, most things you can do to help are 
       guaranteed to be minor. Here is a list of things that you can do to help
       stop global warming:


    <ul>
   
     <li>Power homes with renewable energy</li>
  
     <li>Invest in energy-efficient appliances</li>

     <li>Reduce water waste</li>
 
     <li>Reduce your carbon footprint</li>
   
  <li>Reduce,reuse, recycle</li>
 
     <li>Drive less(use trains, bikes, walk, etc)</li>
 
     <li>Avoid products with a lot of packaging</li>
 
     <li>Turn off lights in rooms you aren't using</li>
 
     <li>Plant trees</li>
 
     <li>Spread awareness</li>
 
     <li>Buy energy efficient products</li>
 
     <li>Use less hot water</li>
 
     <li>Defrost energy efficient products</li>
 
     <li>Cover pots while cooking</li>
 
     <li>Use washing machines and dishwashers when they are full only</li>
  
     <li>Take showers instead of baths</li>

     <li>Buy locally grown and produced food/Buy fresh food instead of frozen</li>
 
     <li>Eat less meat</li>
  
     <li>Don't waste fuel for the car</li>
 
     <li>Protect and conserve forests worlwide</li>
    
</ul>

     
   Joining local groups focused on preventing global warming can also help give 
   you more ideas on how to help prevent this looming threat.
